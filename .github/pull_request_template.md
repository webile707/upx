UPX PULL REQUEST NOTES
======================

Handling pull requests is actually quite time consuming, so please

- if you want to contribute **a real C++ code bug-fix** then open an issue
on the main UPX issue tracker first

- if you want to contribute **a new feature** then by all means open an issue
on the main UPX issue tracker first before starting any coding!

- please refuse the temptation to "improve" the docs, scripts, CI, makefiles,
cmake build system, spelling errors, etc - we will NOT merge this; only open
an issue if you're sure there is a **real bug**
